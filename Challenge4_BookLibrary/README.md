# Book Library

##  Challenge Description

In this challenge, the user is given an APK with an "Add" button and input fields. The goal is to investigate the app and extract the hidden flag.

## Exploitation

1. By the looks of the home page, no direct clue is visible. The app seems to represent a library. Pressing the "Add" button:

2. The next screen allows adding book information, which produces a success message. Still, no meaningful information is revealed.

3. After decompiling the APK using `apktool` and searching with `grep`, no flag is found.

4. Inspecting the decoded files reveals a `MyDatabaseHelper.smali` file. At line 140, it shows that a table named `my_library` is created in an `SQLite` database with the same fields as in the "Add" page.

5. Knowing the app uses `SQLite`, I check the `assets` folder. This folder usually contains databases or files bundled into the APK that are accessible in read-only mode during runtime.

6. Inside the assets folder, I find a file called `BookLibrary`. This is most likely the database. I open it with **DB Browser for SQLite**.

7. The database contains three tables:
   - `android_metadata`: Stores locale/language information.
   - `sqlite_sequence`: Tracks auto-increment values for tables.
   - `my_library`: Contains the user-added books. Entry with `id=2` is the flag.

## What You Learn

- How Android apps can use embedded SQLite databases.
- Locating and inspecting databases in the `assets` folder of an APK.
- Using **DB Browser for SQLite** to explore tables and extract hidden data.
- Understanding standard SQLite internal tables (`android_metadata`, `sqlite_sequence`).

## Notes & Reflections

This challenge highlights how sensitive information can be hidden inside app databases. The tricky part during development was embedding the pre-populated database into the APK so that it would be accessible while keeping the flag non-obvious to the solver.
